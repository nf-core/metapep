## v1.0dev - [2022-01-20]

Pipeline has been re-implemented in [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html)

### `Added`

- [#12](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/12) - Updated documentation
- [#29](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/29) - Added data model figure to `output.md`
- [#45](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/45) - Added support for multiple weights tables for one bin (i.e. co-assembly input)
- [#56](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/56),[#61](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/61) - Updated documentation
- [#67](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/67) - Added parameters to adjust binder/non-binder calling. Additional documentation on scoring by `SYPEITHI`, `MHCflurry`and `MHCnuggets`.
  [#78](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/78) - Added parameter `memory_usage_log_deep` for pandas memory usage logging.
  [#78](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/78) - Added a global chunk size parameter `chunk_size` as well as a scaling parameter `chunk_size_scaling`.
- [#70](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/70) - Added check for supported models and functionality to output all supported models.
- [#75](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/75) - Peptide lengths are checked if supported generally and unified if models are not available in `UNIFY_MODEL_LENGTHS`
- [#80](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/80) - Add mean comparison to entity binding ratios plots.

### `Changed`

- [#26](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/26) - Optimized memory usage of `PREPARE_ENTITY_BINDING_RATIOS`: peptide_ids are processed chunk-wise now. Added `ds_prep_chunk_size` parameter.
- [#32](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/32) - Optimized memory usage of `PREPARE_SCORE_DISTRIBUTION`: peptide_ids are processed chunk-wise now. Peptide `count`s are used for `weight_sum` computation.
- [#33](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/33) - Output already binned scores in `PREPARE_SCORE_DISTRIBUTION` to reduce resources needed for `PLOT_SCORE_DISTRIBUTION`.
- [#36](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/36) - Replaced the tool `csvtk` by custom script for optimized TSV file concatenation in process `MERGE_PREDICTIONS_BUFFER` and `MERGE_PREDICTIONS`.
- [#44](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/44) - Optimized memory usage of `COLLECT_STATS` process
- [#46](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/46) - Input type `taxa` changed from TXT or TSV format to TSV only and increase format checks to ensure passing of optional `abundance` column
- [#55](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/55),[#73](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/73) - Updated `PREDICT_EPITOPES` to use latest epytope version (3.3.1) and adjusted the script `predict_epitopes.py` accordingly. Exchanged the container to official epytope container.
- [#64](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/64), [#65](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/65) - Updated the data model figure and using a white background to ensure readability in both dark and light themes.
- [#76](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/76) - Restructure and rename `CHECK_INPUT` subworkflow to `PREPROCESS_INPUT` and move some channel logic into the subworkflow. Also `CHECK_SAMPLESHEET` module is renamed to `INPUT_TO_DATAMODEL` to have a more descriptive name and circumvent clashing with the nf-core template.
- [#79](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/79) - Replaced multi-package BioContainers by single-package pandas BioContainer and updated containers with old pandas versions
- [#82](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/82) - Add label `error_retry` to process `DOWNLOAD_PROTEINS`
- [#85](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/85) - Changed the output of `UNIFY_MODEL_LENGTHS` to a logfile instead of a tsv

### `Fixed`

- [#11](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/11) - Template update for nf-core/tools version 2.3

- [#21](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/21) - Optimized peptide processing and Pandas joining in process `SPLIT_PRED_TASK` to reduce memory usage.
- [#24](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/24) - Optimized peptide generation in process `GENERATE_PEPTIDES` to reduce memory usage.
- [#40](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/40) - Fix the bins processing workflow, after the co-assembly feature excluded parts of the bins in `GENERATE_PROTEIN_AND_ENTITY_IDS`
- [#58](https://github.com/nf-core/metapep/pull/58) - Ensured deterministic microbiome_id and entity_id assignments.
