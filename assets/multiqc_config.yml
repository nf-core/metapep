    description: "Summary of the number of unique proteins, peptides, unique peptides, binders per condition, as well as binders per allele per condition. The last row corresponds to a total across all conditions. Note: Peptides may occur multiple times within a protein, with proteins occurring multiple times between conditions/entities. Binders are predicted on unique peptides to save computational resources, to map binders back to total peptide numbers to gain insights in high frequency binders the relational database in <OUT_DIR>/db_tables can be used."
