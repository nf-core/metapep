## Introduction

**nf-core/metapep** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for epitope prediction specifically designed for metagenomes. It integrates multiple types of input (proteins, taxa, assemblies and bins), generates peptides and predicts their MHC-/HLA-affinity.

<p align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/metapep_workflow_figure.png" alt="nf-core/metapep workflow overview" width="90%">
</p>

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources.The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/metapep/results).

## Pipeline summary

1. Download proteins for input type taxa from [Entrez](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Web/Search/entrezfs.html).
2. Predict proteins for input type assembly or bins using [Prodigal](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal).
3. Generate peptides from proteins.
4. Split peptide files into chunks for parallel prediction and report stats.
5. Predict epitopes for given alleles and peptides using [SYFPEITHI](http://www.syfpeithi.de), [MHCflurry](https://github.com/openvax/mhcflurry) or [MHCnuggets](https://github.com/KarchinLab/mhcnuggets).
6. Produce plots.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/metapep \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/metapep/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/metapep/parameters).
